# Covid-19-Visualization---SNA-Project
This project done as part of our Social Network Analysis Course
It explains the epidemic spread using social network analysis, based on the given data.
A network is defined and visualization is used to understand the spread of coronavirus among
countries and the impact of other countries on the spread of coronavirus using NetworkX and Gephi. 
The purpose of this project is to represent the COVID-19 spreading around the World using graph / networks theory.
Then, we will study the properties of such a graph. We can use graph / network theory to study
the propagation of the virus. 
It may be useful to understand how the countries should act in case
of a new pandemic. We also used hierarchical clustering model
to find transmission clusters from
the network dataset by clustering based on the dendrogram created using the adjacent matrix of
the network.
